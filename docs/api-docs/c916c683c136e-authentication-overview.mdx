Your OAuth 2.0 `client_id` and `client_secret` credentials can be found in the App Details section of the Developer Console.

There are two OAuth 2.0 flows used to authenticate with the Smokeball API based on your integration scenario:

1. [Authorization Code Grant](/docs/api-docs/2t26gcuuqf1wk-authorization-code-grant) - This is used to connect to the Smokeball API as an authenticated Smokeball user. The Smokeball user will authenticate using their credentials and an authorization code is passed back to your supplied redirect uri(s) which you can then exchange for an access token.

2. [Client Credentials Grant](/docs/api-docs/h72024p76i8e1-client-credentials-grant) - This flow is used when connecting to the Smokeball API for server-to-server requests outside the context of a Smokeball user.

Additionally, we provide a [Logout Endpoint](/docs/api-docs/9de98u0xqsckx-logout-endpoint) for securely ending user sessions.
