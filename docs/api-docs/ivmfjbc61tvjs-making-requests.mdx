All requests to the API require a valid `api-key` issued by Smokeball and `access_token` (see [Authentication](/docs/api-docs/c916c683c136e-authentication-overview)).

Make sure to include the appropriate scopes in your app settings before attempting any API requests.

## Example Request

## Paged Responses

You will notice that some requests will have the optional parameters `limit` and `offset`. These are used to control how many results are returned in a request that returns a list of results. 

In the response above, you can see the details of the paging properties in the first section of the response:

``` json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "href": "https://api.smokeball.com/contacts",
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 500,
  "size": 761,
  "first": {
    "href": "https://api.smokeball.com/contacts"
  },
  "next": {
    "href": "https://api.smokeball.com/contacts?limit=500&offset=500",
    "rel": "collection"
  },
  "last": {
    "href": "https://api.smokeball.com/contacts?limit=500&offset=500",
    "rel": "collection"
  }
}
```

**Paging Properties**

Property | Description 
---------|----------
 `offset` | The number at which the results set begins 
 `limit` | The number of results in the response 
 `size` | The total number of results
 `first` | A link to the first result set
 `next` | A link to the next result set
 `last` | A link to the last result set

>By default, the `limit` will be set to a maximum of 500 results. 

## Server-to-Server requests

When using the [Client Credentials Grant](1-Authentication.md#2-client-credentials-grant) to perform server-to-server requests, you must explicitly specify which account you are using by prefixing the url with the `accountId` in this format:

> https://api.smokeball.com/{accountId}/{resource-path}

Using the above contacts request as an example, the url is https://api.smokeball.com/contacts/
For a server-to-server request using the `accountId: ea4ca7b9-b826-4840-a8k5-94e6c6937c65` the request would be:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash curl
  curl --request GET "https://api.smokeball.com/ea4ca7b9-b826-4840-a8k5-94e6c6937c65/contacts/" \
    --header "x-api-key: Y2xpZW50X2lkOmNsaWV" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer Y2xpZW50X2lkOmNsaWV"
  ```
  ```json http
  {
    "method": "get",
  "url": "https://api.smokeball.com/ea4ca7b9-b826-4840-a8k5-94e6c6937c65/contacts/",
  "headers": {
    "x-api-key": "Y2xpZW50X2lkOmNsaWV",
    "Authorization": "Bearer Y2xpZW50X2lkOmNsaWV"
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

**Response**

### Acting on behalf of a user

Because server-to-server requests are not performed using a user token there is no `userId` associated with each request. A `userId` is necessary for permission checking or ensuring that the UI reflects the change done by the specified user.

To act on behalf of a certain user simply supply the `UserId` header with your requests. The value must be that of a [User](/api-reference/firm-users/get-firm-staffuser-mappings) in the firm.

## Tracking your requests

Since all POST/PUT requests are handled asynchronously by the Smokeball API, it is useful to be able to track the changes especially when using [Webhooks](/docs/api-docs/wivbkstcwngb5-webhooks). This is acheived by supplying the `RequestId` header with your requests. 

If the `RequestId` header is supplied, it will be returned as a response header for every request you make. It will also be included in all webhook callbacks so you can track what data was impacted by your request.
