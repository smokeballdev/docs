title: "Client Credentials Grant"
---

The **Client Credentials** grant type is typically used for server-to-server API operations. In this scenario, you are not acting as a Smokeball user but a type of "service" that can perform operations on an Account level.

## Request an Access Token

Make a POST request to `https://auth.smokeball.com/oauth2/token` with the following parameters and headers:

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "https://auth.smokeball.com/oauth2/token",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Basic Y2xpZW50X2lkOmNsaWVudF9zZWNyZXQ=",
    "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"    
  },
  "body": {
    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
    "client_id": "xxxx"
  }
}
```

> The **Authorization** header must be the string "Basic" followed by your client_id and client_secret with a colon : in between, Base64 Encoded. For example, client_id:client_secret is Y2xpZW50X2lkOmNsaWVudF9zZWNyZXQ=

**Sample Response**

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "access_token": "dmcxd329ujdmkemkd349r...",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```
