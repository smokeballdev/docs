title: "Introduction"
description: "The Smokeball API conforms to [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLS, accepts [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) request bodies, returns [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) and uses standard [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) status codes and verbs."

## 2\. Throttling & Limits

Throttling and limiting is a policy that affects the frequency an API can be called. They are put in place to protect server infrastructure from abuse or misuse. Smokeball employs rate limits to enable consistent load allocation across our platform.

The Smokeball API uses the [token bucket algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket). Smokeball API partners are assigned a "Burst" and "Rate" Limit.

The **burst** limit defines the number of requests the API can handle concurrently.

The **rate** limit defines the number of allowed requests per second.

Unless otherwise specified, Smokeball API partners are assigned the limits below:

| Region | Rate (requests per second) | Burst (concurrent requests) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| US | 5 | 5 |
| AU | 5 | 5 | 
| UK | 5 | 5 |
