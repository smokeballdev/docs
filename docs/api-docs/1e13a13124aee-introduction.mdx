title: "Introduction"
description: "The Smokeball API conforms to [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLS, accepts [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) request bodies, returns [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) and uses standard [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) status codes and verbs."

- **Base URLs**: Different URLs for authentication and API requests, varying by region and environment
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0-based authentication flow for secure access
- **Rate Limits**: Request throttling to ensure consistent platform performance
- **Request Format**: JSON request/response format with standard HTTP methods
