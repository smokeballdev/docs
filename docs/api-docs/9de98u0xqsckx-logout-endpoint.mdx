title: "Logout Endpoint"

The `/logout` endpoint is a redirection endpoint. It signs the user out and redirects either to an authorized sign-out URL for your app client, or to the /login endpoint. The available parameters in a GET request to the `/logout` endpoint are tailored to Amazon Cognito hosted UI use cases.
