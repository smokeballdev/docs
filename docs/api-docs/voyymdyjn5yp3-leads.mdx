## Lead Matter Types

Smokeball comes with a range of pre-configured lead matter types for different areas of law. These are provided by Smokeball's internal content team and are not user editable.

A lead matter type is used to assign the lead being created to a relevant area of law and state / location.

> The matter types used when creating a 'Lead' are different from the one's used to create a 'Matter'.

When creating a lead in Smokeball we can see a list of lead Matter Types. Here, _Company Formation_ is a lead matter type, under the _Business_ category.

}
```

> Here the important information to note is the `id` and `representativeOptions` of the lead matter type. We'll need those when creating a lead.

## Contacts

In order to successfully create a lead, we're going to need to provide a contact that is the potential client.

In Smokeball's desktop app you can create a contact as a Person, Firm/Business/Organization or Trust.
Right now, the API supports the following contact types

- Person
- Company

![New Contact](../../assets/images/newcontact.png)

#### API - Creating a Contact

To create a contact you can make the following request which would create a person called 'Test Contact'.

```json http
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://api.smokeball.com/contacts",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": "{\n  \"person\": {\n    \"firstName\": \"Test\",\n    \"lastName\": \"Contact\",    \n    \"email\": \"test@gmail.com\",\n  }\n}\n\n"
}
```

**Response**

```json
202 Accepted

{
  "id": "9a9ce552-6bee-45e4-8eb1-afe2c18c489f",
  "href": "https://api.smokeball.com/contacts/9a9ce552-6bee-45e4-8eb1-afe2c18c489f"
}
```

Take note of the Contact's `id` returned in the response, we'll need that when creating a lead.
Alternatively, if the contact already exists in Smokeball, you can query it to find it's id.

> ### _Tip_
>
> When creating a contact you can pass in an `externalSystemId` if you want to store your own reference id with this contact.

## Staff

In Smokeball, staff can be assigned to a lead as the **Attorney Responsible** or the **Person Assisting**. The lead list can then be filtered by Attorney responsible, etc.

![Staff](../../assets/images/staff.png)

If you want to specify the Attorney Responsible or Person Assisting when creating a lead via the API, then we will first need to retrieve the staff member's id.

```json http
{
  "method": "get",
  "url": "https://api.smokeball.com/staff"
}
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "href": "https://api.smokeball.com/staff",

  "first": {
    "href": "https://api.smokeball.com/staff"
  },

      "versionId": "cfdbb798-1f2e-4355-87bc-620cbc62acc2",
      "firstName": "Test",

## Creating a lead

Now we have everything we need to create a lead.

```json http
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://api.smokeball.com/matters",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": {
    "matterTypeId": "8aca3574-aecb-4a6f-991d-680861bece1d_IL",
    "clientIds": [
      "9a9ce552-6bee-45e4-8eb1-afe2c18c489f"
    ],
    "clientRole": "Borrower",
    "description": "Created via API",
    "status": "Open",
    "dateOpened": "2020-05-20T04:20:55.035Z",

    "isLead": true
  }
}
```

Here we have used:

 `clientIds` | An array containing the id of the `Test Contact` we created 
 `clientRole` |  Set to _Borrower_ which is one of the lead matter type's representativeOptions retrieved earlier

 `description` | A free text entry field for the description of the lead
 `status` | Can be `Open`, `Pending`, `Closed`, `Deleted` or `Cancelled`
 `isLead` | This is a boolean flag to indicate that the matter is being created as a `Lead`. This must be set to `true` when creating a `Lead`
