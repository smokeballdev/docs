Welcome to Smokeball's app development platform. This guide covers everything you need to know about building powerful integrations and applications that extend Smokeball's capabilities.

## What are Apps?

Apps are self-contained applications that can be developed and deployed on our platform. They provide specific functionality and can be integrated with other services.

## Authorization and Access

Apps provide the necessary authentication and authorization mechanisms to securely access firm data through the Smokeball API:

- When you create an app, you receive API keys and credentials
- Firms explicitly authorize your app to access their data
- OAuth 2.0 flows ensure secure authentication
- Access tokens are scoped to specific permissions
- Firms can revoke access at any time

This secure authorization model ensures:
- Firms maintain control over their data
- Access is properly authenticated
- Permissions are clearly defined

You can manage your app's settings and API credentials through the [Developer Console](https://console.smokeball.com).
