## What are Smokeball Apps?

Smokeball apps are self-contained applications that extend Smokeball's functionality by integrating with firm data and workflows. Apps provide a secure, standardized way for third-party developers and firms to build custom solutions on top of the Smokeball platform.

## App Architecture

### Components

A Smokeball app typically consists of:

1. **Client Application** - Your web, desktop, or mobile application
2. **API Integration** - Calls to Smokeball API endpoints to access firm data
3. **Webhook Subscriptions** (optional) - Real-time notifications for events
4. **Authentication Flow** - OAuth 2.0 implementation for secure access

### Integration Patterns

Apps can integrate with Smokeball in different ways:

- **API-only apps** - Cloud-based applications that interact via REST API
- **Webhook-driven apps** - Event-driven integrations that respond to real-time notifications
- **Plugin apps** (coming soon) - Native integrations using the Smokeball Client SDK
- **Hybrid apps** - Combination of API, webhooks, and SDK

## App Types

Smokeball supports two types of apps, each designed for different use cases:

### Public Apps

Public apps are designed to be used by multiple Smokeball firms:

- **Use Case**: SaaS products, marketplace integrations, third-party services
- **Distribution**: Available through the Smokeball App Marketplace
- **Credentials**: Single set of client credentials for all firms
- **Authentication**: Authorization Code Grant
- **Ideal For**: Software vendors, integration partners, marketplace apps

**Example Use Cases:**
- Document automation platforms
- Client portal solutions
- Legal practice management integrations
- Billing and accounting integrations

### Private Apps

Private apps are designed for single-firm use only:

- **Use Case**: Custom internal integrations, firm-specific workflows
- **Distribution**: Private to your firm only
- **Credentials**: Unique credentials for your firm
- **Authentication**: Client Credentials Grant or Authorization Code Grant (OAuth 2.0)
- **Ideal For**: Individual firms, custom internal tools, proof-of-concept projects

**Example Use Cases:**
- Custom reporting dashboards
- Internal automation workflows
- Legacy system integrations
- Data migration tools

## Authorization and Access

All apps use OAuth 2.0 to securely access firm data through the Smokeball API:

### How Authorization Works

1. **App Registration** - Create an app in the [Developer Console](https://console.smokeball.com)
2. **Credentials** - Receive client ID and client secret
3. **Firm Authorization** - Firms explicitly authorize your app
4. **Access Tokens** - Obtain scoped access tokens via OAuth 2.0
5. **API Calls** - Use tokens to make authenticated API requests

### Security Features

- **Scoped Permissions**: Apps request only the data they need
- **Secure Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 industry standard
- **Token Expiration**: Access tokens expire and must be refreshed
- **Audit Trail**: All API access is logged

## App Lifecycle

### 1. Development

- Create app in Developer Console
- Configure authentication settings
- Set up development environment
- Build and test in staging environment

### 2. Testing

- Test OAuth flow
- Verify API integrations
- Test webhook handling
- Validate error handling

### 3. Deployment

- **Private Apps**: Deploy and use immediately
- **Public Apps**: Submit for review, then publish to marketplace

### 4. Maintenance

- Monitor API usage
- Handle version updates
- Respond to firm support requests
- Track error rates and performance

## Managing Your Apps

Use the [Developer Console](https://console.smokeball.com) to:

- Create and configure apps
- Manage API credentials
- Set OAuth redirect URIs
- Configure webhook subscriptions
- Monitor app usage and performance
- View error logs and analytics
