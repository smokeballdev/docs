This guide addresses frequently encountered problems and their solutions.

## Partner Invite Password Expired

If your temporary password from a partner program invitation has expired:

1. Contact our [support team](https://support.smokeball.com) to request a new invitation
2. We'll send you a fresh invite with a new temporary password
3. Use the new password to complete your account setup within 24 hours

<Note>
Partner invitation passwords expire after 7 days for security purposes. Be sure to set up your account promptly after receiving a new invite.
</Note>

## Smokeball Login Issues
If you're unable to log in to Smokeball, this is because  Partner accounts and Smokeball accounts are for separate systems:

- Partner accounts are used for accessing the Developer Console and Partner Portal
- Smokeball accounts are firm-specific logins used to access the Smokeball application
- Your partner credentials cannot be used to log into Smokeball directly

If you need a Smokeball account for testing:

1. Contact our partners team to request a test account
2. Specify which environment and region you need access to
3. We'll provision a dedicated Smokeball account for your testing needs

<Note>
Smokeball accounts are environment and region-specific, tied to individual firms. Your partner portal credentials won't work for logging into Smokeball directly - you need separate Smokeball account credentials.
</Note>

<Warning>
Don't try using your partner portal or developer console credentials to log in to Smokeball. These are separate systems that require different authentication.
</Warning>

## Missing TOTP/2FA Code

If you're being prompted for a TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) code but haven't set up 2FA:

1. Contact our [support team](https://support.smokeball.com) to request a Partner account reset
2. We'll verify your identity and reset your 2FA settings
3. You can then set up a new authenticator during your next login

<Note>
TOTP codes are required for all partner accounts as an additional security measure.
</Note>

## OAuth Login Issues
If you're encountering OAuth login issues, first verify you're using the correct authorization URL:

- Check that you're using the base authorization URL as specified in our [API Documentation](/docs/api-docs/1e13a13124aee-introduction)
- Ensure you're using the correct environment-specific URL (staging vs production)
- Verify your redirect URI exactly matches one registered in your app settings

Common OAuth login issues include:

- Using incorrect environment URLs
- Mismatched redirect URIs 
- Missing or invalid scopes
- Incorrect client credentials

<Warning>
Using the wrong base authorization URL will cause OAuth flows to fail. Always reference the official API documentation for the correct endpoints.
</Warning>

## Rate Limits
If you're experiencing API rate limits, this is expected behavior to ensure platform stability and fair usage:

- Rate limits are enforced per client ID and endpoint
- Refer to our [API Documentation](/docs/api-docs/1e13a13124aee-introduction) for specific limits
- Use exponential backoff when retrying rate-limited requests
- Consider caching frequently accessed data

<Note>
Rate limits help maintain platform stability and ensure fair access for all integrations. Your app should be designed to work within these constraints.
</Note>

<Warning>
Rate limit increases are only granted in exceptional circumstances. Design your integration to work efficiently within the standard limits.
</Warning>

## Handling 401 Unauthorized Errors
If you encounter a 401 Unauthorized error when calling the API, it typically indicates an authentication or permission issue. Here are the most common causes and how to resolve them:

- **Insufficient Permissions**: The access token being used does not have the necessary permissions to access the requested resource. Ensure the authenticated user or application has the correct roles or access levels.

- **Incorrect or Missing Scopes**: The token was generated without the required scopes. Double-check your appâ€™s configuration to make sure you've requested the appropriate scopes. For more information, refer to [Building your app](/docs/platform-docs/867hiv3k5bt1u-build-app#scopes).

- **Invalid Account or User ID (Server-to-Server Requests)**: If you're making server-to-server API calls, verify that the AccountId or UserId you're passing is correct and valid for your environment.
