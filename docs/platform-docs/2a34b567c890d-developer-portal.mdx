The Smokeball Developer Console contains a set of self-serve tools that developers can use to manage their access to the Smokeball API and platform services.

In the portal, you can:
- Create and manage your Smokeball Apps (and the authentication keys and tokens that they provide)
- Manage your access levels and integrations with the Smokeball API endpoints
