Smokeball accounts differ per region (AU/US/UK) and environment (Staging/Production). You can create a new account for each environment you need to access.

The Accounts page in the Developer Console allows you to manage your staging and production accounts. This page provides a centralized location to view and configure your account settings for both environments.

If an account doesn't exist, you can create one using the "Create Account" button. This will guide you through the process of setting up a new account for your chosen environment.

A prompt will appear to confirm the account creation details.

Once created, an email will be sent to the account email address with a temporary password to set up the account.
