To develop integrations with Smokeball, you'll need to go through our partner approval process. This ensures we work with companies that align with our values and can provide complementary solutions to our legal practice management software.

## Step 1: Partner Application

Start by applying to become a Smokeball partner. You'll need to provide:
- Information about your company
- Details about your proposed integration
- Your target market and client base
- Your distribution strategy and target regions

This helps us understand how your solution complements Smokeball and benefits our mutual clients.

Once approved:
- You'll receive access to our developer resources
- Can begin building your integration
- Get support from our developer relations team

## Step 2: Security Review

After you have tested your integration in our staging environment and it is submitted for review, we'll:
- Ask security-related questions about your solution
- Review your data handling practices
- Discuss integration security measures

## Next Steps

Once your integration passes our security review:
- Your app will be promoted to our production environment
- You can list your solution on the Smokeball Marketplace
- You'll gain access to our production API endpoints and credentials
- You can begin onboarding real customers

The Smokeball Marketplace gives you exposure to thousands of law firms looking to enhance their practice management capabilities.
