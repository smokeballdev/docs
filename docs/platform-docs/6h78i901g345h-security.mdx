This guide covers essential security practices for handling authentication tokens and securing your app on the Smokeball platform.

## Best Practices

Here are essential security practices for handling OAuth 2.0 authentication tokens in your application:

### Secure Token Storage

- Never store access tokens or refresh tokens in client-side code, local storage, or cookies
- Store tokens securely on your backend server using:
  - Encrypted databases
  - Key management services (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, etc.)
- Use environment variables for sensitive credentials in development
- Implement proper access controls and audit logging for token access

### Token Handling

- Only transmit tokens over HTTPS/TLS
- Implement token refresh using the supplied refresh token
- Revoke compromised tokens immediately or contact us if you think you have been compromised
